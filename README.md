# Deep-Learning-Tumor-Fibers-Segmentation

Project not Finished yet.
Currently working on it, will update asap.
Keep Calm.
Stay Tuned.

All the codes are written under PyTorch framework, and are designed for one or more GPUs acceleration.

The pretrained weights for the saliency detection network can be found on PyTorch Hub. By the way, this network has been designed to respect the architecture of those same weights, so you can just load them and run the code.
